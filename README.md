# BST-AVL Tree Visualiser
## Overview
BST-AVL Tree Visualiser is an interactive tool designed to help students, educators, and enthusiasts understand the fundamentals of Binary Search Trees (BST) and Adelson-Velsky and Landis (AVL) trees. This project provides a visual representation of how these trees are constructed, how they maintain balance, and how operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching are performed.
## Features
- ***Menu-Driven Interface:*** Easy-to-navigate level 1 and level 2 menus to perform various operations.
  
- ***Load Pre-Loaded Tree:*** Option to load a pre-existing BST/AVL to quickly start exploring.
  
- ***Manual Tree Construction:*** Users can manually enter a sequence of integers to construct a Tree.
  
- ***Tree Visualization:*** Dynamically generates a textual representation of the BST, making it easier to visualize the structure and understand tree operations.
    
- ***Traversal Operations:*** Supports pre-order, in-order, post-order, and inverse in-order traversal, offering comprehensive insights into different ways to navigate a Tree.
  
- ***Node Operations:*** Allows users to insert new nodes, delete existing nodes, and search for specific nodes within the tree.
  
- ***Subtree Visualisation:*** Provides functionality to display a sub-tree and count its nodes, facilitating focused analysis of tree segments.
  
- ***Node Depth:*** Calculates the depth of a specific node or the entire subtree, aiding in the understanding of tree balance and depth-related properties.

- ***Leaf and Non-Leaf Node Display:*** Distinguishes between leaf and non-leaf nodes, highlighting the structure and depth of the tree.
  

## Usage
- ***Level 1 Menu***
    - Here you can choose to either `manually enter` a sequence of integers or `pre-load` a Tree. ![Screenshot 2024-03-11 233808](https://github.com/NicholasFoti/BST-AVL-Tree-Visualiser/assets/141711632/cd06cbe9-aa61-4727-94d4-378c4724a605)

- ***Level 2 Menu***
    - The level 2 menu is the heart of the application. This menu grants the users access to all the different functions they can perform to manipulate the tree.
